# Books (better naming came later, sorry. I would name it "BookSearchApp")

This is a test and simple app for iOS platform, which was written on Swift.

In this demo application was used VIPER architecture and some of desgin patterns.

Also, its UI is fully programmatically and based on Protocol Oriented Programming. 

There are a lot interesting things like:
- Managers;
- Abstract Endpoint, JSON object Mapping, Service protocols and realization; 
- Custom Views;
- Factory desing pattern;
- Best practice extensions;
- Helper;
- Error Catching and showing it.

And finally I had to edit Info.plist to allow arbitrary loads.
